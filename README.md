## 1. What is a Web Framework?
A **web framework is a collection of tools and libraries that help developers build web applications** quickly and efficiently. Web frameworks handle common tasks such as *routing URLs to code, rendering HTML templates, managing HTTP requests and responses*, and more.

### Examples of Web Frameworks:
- `Flask`: A micro-framework for Python, known for its simplicity.
- `Django`: A more feature-rich, all-in-one framework for Python.
- `Express`: A minimal web framework for `Node.js`.

### Why Use a Web Framework?
Using a web framework allows you to **focus on the unique aspects of your application, while the framework handles the repetitive and complex tasks** associated with web development.
